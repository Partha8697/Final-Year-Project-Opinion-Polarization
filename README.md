Among different aspects of social networks, dynamics have been proposed to simulate how opinions can be transmitted. In this study, we propose a model that simulates the communication in an online social network, 
in which the posts are created from external information. We considered the nodes and edges of a network as users and their friendship, respectively. A real number is associated with each user representing its 
opinion. The dynamics starts with a user that has contact with a random opinion, and, according to a given probability function, this individual can post this opinion. This step is henceforth called post 
transmission. In the next step, called post distribution, another probability function is employed to select the userâ€™s friends that could see the post. Post transmission and distribution represent the user and 
the social network algorithm, respectively. If an individual has contact with a post, its opinion can be attracted or repulsed. Furthermore, individuals that are repulsed can change their friendship through a 
rewiring. These steps are executed various times until the dynamics converge. Several impressive results were obtained, which include the formation of scenarios of polarization and consensus of opinions. In the case 
of echo chambers, the possibility of rewiring probability is found to be decisive. However, for particular network topologies, with a well-defined community structure, this effect can also happen. All in all, the 
results indicate that the post distribution strategy is crucial to mitigate or promote polarization.
